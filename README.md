# Go-slack-poll
A simple Slack app that provides multiple-choice polling functionality. Users can vote for one or more choices by clicking on buttons in an interactive Slack message created by the bot using a Slack slash command.

## Adding the pollbot to your Slack workspace
Before you begin, you'll need to have the bot running at a publicly accessible domain. Prefereably, you would have a reverse proxy or load balancer with HTTPS support in front of the bot.

1. As a Slack admin, browse to [https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) and click on [Create New App]
1. Give the app a name (ex. "Poll Bot") and select the Slack workspace it should be connected with. Click [Create App]
1. Under "Features" select "Interactive Components"
1. Turn on "Interactivity" and fill in the "Request URL" with your bot's domain name, followed by `/interaction`:
    ```
    https://yourdomain.com/interaction
    ```
    and [Save Changes]
1. Under "Features" select "Slash Commands" and [Create New Command]
1. Pick a clear name for the command (ex. "/pollbot") and for the Request URL enter your bot's domain, followed by `/command`:
    ```
    https://yourdomain.com/command
    ```
    For "Short Description", enter "Creates a poll". For "Usage Hint" enter:
    ```
    "Title" "Choice 1" "Choice 2" ...
    ```
    Make sure "Escape channels, users, and links sent to your app" is enabled, and [Save]
1. Under "OAuth & Permissions", make sure your app has `chat:write:bot` and `commands` permissions. Click [Save]
1. Under "Settings" select "Install App" and [Install App to Workplace]

## Starting the pollbot
Go-slack-poll uses Redis for persistence of its polls. If you have Docker and the `docker-compose` utility installed, you can easily spin up all of the necessary infrastructure from the command line. From the root of this repo, run:
```
$ SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=YourAppSigningSecret docker-compose up
```

## Starting the pollbot with Kubernetes and Helm
The pollbot and supporting Redis cluster can easily be installed on an existing Kubernetes cluster using [Helm](https://helm.sh/) from the chart included in this repo. Once you have `helm` installed, run:
```
$ helm install ./helm/go-slack-poll \
    --name go-slack-poll \
    --set env.slackSigningSecret=`echo "YourAppSigningSecret" | base64`
```

## Creating a poll in Slack
You can create a poll in Slack using the `/pollbot` command (or whatever slash command you have configured in your Slack app settings):
```
/pollbot "Is this pollbot just the best?" "Yes üéâ" "No üôÅ"
```
